        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>Khan was born in Karachi on 29 November 1981 into a Pathan family, and speaks Punjabi as his first language.
            His father was born in Patiala, British India (now Punjab, India), and moved to Pakistan at a young age
            after the 1947 partition. His mother's family originated in Lucknow, British India (now Uttar Pradesh). When
            Khan was young, his father was in pharmaceutical sales, which required the family to live in Athens, Dubai,
            Riyadh and Manchester during the Gulf War. His family returned to Lahore when he was 13.Since childhood,
            Khan has been a fan of Amitabh Bachchan and Rishi Kapoor. He has two sisters; his older sister, Aliya, is an
            architect and his younger sister, Sana, is a physician</p>
        <p>The actor studied at an American school, where he said he faced racial issues and was bullied because of his
            shy, calm, non-combative nature. Khan passed his A-levels at the Lahore Grammar School (LGS), and received a
            bachelor's degree in software engineering from the National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences
            (NUCES) in Lahore. Because he could not find a job as a programmer, he soon began acting. In a Forbes India
            interview, Khan said that he had also failed to find a job in marketing. By then he could play guitar, bass
            and drums, and became Entity Paradigm's lead singer. Khan's first amateur performance was in the title role
            of a play, Spartacus.</p>
